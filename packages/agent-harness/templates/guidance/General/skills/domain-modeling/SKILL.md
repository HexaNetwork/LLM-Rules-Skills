# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill — that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File locations

**Harness:** use `domainArtifacts` from the work packet (`glossaries`, optional `glossaryMap`, `adrDirs`). Do not search for glossary/ADR locations.

**Empty lists:** create root `GLOSSARY.md` / `docs/adr` lazily when first needed.

**Multi-context:** if `glossaryMap` is set, read it to choose which glossary; if unclear, ask.

**Standalone (non-harness):** find or create root `GLOSSARY.md`; if `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists, follow it.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
